# Data Mining GUI Project



## Overview

This project is the result of my module on data mining, where I developed a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for efficient data mining processing. The GUI is built using Jupyter Notebook and PySimpleGUI, providing a user-friendly experience for data analysts and researchers.

## Features

- Data Visualization
- Data Cleaning
- Dataset Splitting
- Machine Learning Models

## Demo

Check out the video demo on https://www.linkedin.com/posts/benelfqih-aya_datamining-projectcompletion-jupyternotebook-activity-7155188704590897152-Zcak?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop for a walkthrough of the GUI and its functionalities.
